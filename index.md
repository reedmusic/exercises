## Jazz listening resources

 * Each page starts with <b>General listening</b>
 * Then some <b>Focused listening</b> with questions. 
     * There may be research on artists or techniques (Wikipedia is a great resource for albums and personnel...).    
     * Sometimes the answers will appear in <span style="color:red">red</span>, sometimes we'll wait for the lesson to reveal all.
