## General listening

### Lester Young

Lester Young was a 1930s/40s pioneer of what would become Cool Jazz. He was well known for his lyrical, vibrato, breathy tenor sax tone played high in the register. 

Here he is in the Count Basie band in 1939 with Count Basie's Kansas City Seven. An example of a piece in a Swing style, but **not** Big Band.

Listen to the head of 'Stardust' (1954). Here he is accompanied by the Oscar Peterson (pianist) trio:
