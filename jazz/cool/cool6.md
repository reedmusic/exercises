1967 is a little late for Eduqas, but this standard is still a good listen, with elements of cool jazz and the 1960s bossa nova craze.

1. The tempo is around 140 BPM. How many bars long is the introduction?

	<details>16 bars.</details>
	
2. The head contains a number of 8-bar sections. How many are there, and so how many bars long is the head overall?

	<details>5 x 8-bar sections = 40 bars.</details>
	
2. Define the structure of the head section using letter names.

	<details>AABAA. Note the repeated A section at the end of the form that makes it 40 and not 32 bars.</details>
	
2. The bass plays a repeating two-bar rhythm throughout. Dictate this rhythm.
