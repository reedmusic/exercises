1. Describe the music played by the drums in the introduction[^1]

	<details>
		<ul>
			<li>Woodblock</li>

3. We hear the head twice at the beginning. How many bars long is it?

	<details>18. There is an extra repetition of the final phrase (the turnaround).</details>
	
2. Describe the structure of the head in letters
	<details>AABA (A, A' or C to finish. More ambiguous than usual since that final section has two extra bars and starts with a melodic development from the B section).</details>
	
3. Describe how the music played by the rhythm section changes during the B sections in the head (e.g. at 0:23)

	<details>
		<ul>
			<li>Bass starts walking</li>
			<li>Drums play swing quavers on the ride cymbal. No more woodblock.</li>
		</ul>
	</details>
