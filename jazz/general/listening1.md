1. Describe the texture of the introduction

	<details>Polyphonic/contrapuntal</details>
	
2. Give the timings when the head starts and ends (i.e. where does the next section start?)

	<details>0:13, 1:07</details>
	
2. Name the instrument that plays the head.

	<details>Vibraphone</details>
	
2. Find the name of the percussionist who plays this.

2. Who are the MJQ?

	<details>Modern Jazz Quartet</details>
	
3. Compare the rhythm of the introduction and head sections

	<details>The introduction uses straight quavers and the head uses swung quavers</details>
	
4. Identify the structure of the head.

	<details>AABA. 32-bar song form.</details>
	
6. Describe how the harmonic rhythm changes through the head.

	<details>The A sections have a faster harmonic rhythm: either one or two changes per bar. The B section has generally one chord change every two bars.</details>

5. Describe the (other aspects of) harmony and tonality of the head section.

	<details>
	<ul>
		<li>The A sections mainly focus on the tonic chord. The chord progression in the A sections is very repetitive, arriving at Chord V and then descending back down to i each time.</li>
		<li>The head is in a minor key.</li>
		<li>The B section starts in the relative major key. However this quickly modulates back to the tonic minor.</li>
	</ul>
	</details>
	

3. Find the name of the drummer.

	<details>Kenny Clarke</details>

12. Describe the music played by the piano in the head section
	
	<details>A sections of the head are played in octaves. In the B section they improvise instead of playing the melody. The B section uses comping in the left hand. Chord extensions used, e.g. a V7#9 chord in the final turnaround</details>
	
1. How many solo choruses does the pianist play? Give the time each chorus starts. (I have to count the bars and beats on my fingers to keep track.)

	<details>4 choruses in total. Each is about 38 seconds long.
	
	<ol>
		<li>0:39</li>
		<li>1:17</li>
		<li>1:55</li>
		<li>2:32. This starts with four bars of dominant pedals at the start of the first two A sections.</li>
		<li>Coltrane starts at 3:10</li>
	</ol>
	
	</details>
